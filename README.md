## Introduction
Interdisciplinary research can be tricky, as it may require both generalist and specialist perspectives. This is often achieved by conducting research in teams. For instance,  medical image analysis research is often conducted by a team consisting of clinicians, and researchers with expertise in biology or imaging/computer vision. Although all members may be specialists in their own respect, a lack of understanding in the disciplines of other members may cause a cause ineffective communication within the team, leading to frustration, disconnect, and lack of effectiveness. Thus, to an extent, a generalist perspective is also required for effective research.

This 'book' is written as a resource and reference to various concepts that I have come across throughout my PhD, and what I believe are required for a strong understanding of medical image analysis. Prerequisite concepts for pathomics (digital pathology) and radiomics, such as math, statistics, histology, cancer biology etc. are covered.
